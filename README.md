# Escape From Tarkov Nucleus Co-op Handler

## Introduction
Nucleus Co-op is an open-source tool that allows you to play games locally with your friends using split-screen. It enables multiple instances of the same game to run on one PC, allowing each player to have their own screen and input devices. This handler enables split-screen support for the game Escape From Tarkov using Nucleus Co-op.

## Requirements
Before using this handler, make sure you have the following:
- Escape From Tarkov Legitimate Copy (yes, you need to buy the game.)
- SPT mod (formerly known as SPT-AKI) this mod lets you play on your own server - Download here: https://sp-tarkov.com/
- Amands Controller mod for SPT (if you plan on playing controllers, you can use multiple keyboard mouse if you wish) - Download here: https://hub.sp-tarkov.com/files/file/1550-amands-controller/#overview
- You don't necessarily need a local server running, but if you plan to play entirely local then you need to run Aki.Server.exe to host a local server in order for the clients to connect.
- Project Fika (this is a must in order to connect to play raids together on the same server via websockets)
